Omega Leo Club is a youth organisation of Lions Club International. The acronym L.E.O stands for Leadership, Experience, Opportunity.

Our objective is, to provide the youth of the world with an opportunity for development and contribution, individually and collectively, as responsible members of the local, national and international community. 

We encourage the youth to develop leadership qualities by participating in social service activities. Addressed as "Leos", we conduct various projects for health care, elders, children, differently abled, literacy and education, and self-development.


####Kindness in Action

When caring people join together, roll up their sleeves and take action to make their community better, it’s a beautiful thing—and an incredible feeling for everyone involved. That’s Leos. Being a Leo is about leading by example, building relationships and improving the world through kindness. There’s more than a million caring men and women serving together so they can make a lasting impact and change more lives.


####Motto

"To promote service activities among the youth of the community which will develop the individual qualities of Leadership, Experience and Opportunity. To unite its members in friendship, fellowship and mutual understanding." With this motto, we Leos are contributing our bit to make this world a better place.
