We help children unlock their potential and realise their dreams. We believe that every child is extraordinary and can scale great heights if provided with the right learning opportunities. With regular and generous contribution from our members of leo club, we provide tuition to children at servant quarter of juit campus. A team of 5-6 members teache every weekday around 30 students. We got a great success in past few months only. The grades of students have risen significantly.The realisation of being helpful just through our knowledge gives immense joy and satisfaction.
