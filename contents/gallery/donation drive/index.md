For most of us, the idea of winter means cuddling under the blanket for warmth, lying in our comfort zone. But for those on the streets, with every drop in the temperatures itâ€™s a fight for survival.

Every winter, our club organizes a Donation Drive. Where we provide unused items like clothes, shoes, blankets of Students and faculty  to the underprivileged, living in the open . This generous deed has been appreciated by all the faculty members as well as the students.
